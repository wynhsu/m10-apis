### Exercise 2 ###

# As you noticed, it often takes multiple queries to retrieve the desired information.
# This is a perfect situation in which writing a function will allow you to better structure your
# code, and give a name to a repeated task.

data <- fromJSON('https://api.spotify.com/v1/search?q=nelly&type=artist')

# Write a function that allows you to specify an artist, and returns the top 10 tracks of that artist

  base <- 'https://api.spotify.com/v1/'
  artist.query <- paste0(base, 'search?', 'q=', artist, '&type=artist')

  top.tracks <- fromJSON(album.query)
  return(top.tracks$tracks)
}

# What are the top 10 tracks by Nelly?
top.nelly <- TopTenTracks('Nelly')

### Bonus ### 
# Write a function that allows you to specify a search type (artist, album, etc.), and a string, 
# that returns the album/artist/etc. page of interest


# Search albums with the word "Sermon"
